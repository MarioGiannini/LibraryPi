# LibraryPi
A PHP/MySQL/Tesseract/BookReader website originally developed on Raspberry Pi

Full documentation on the development of Library Pi is available at www.librarypi.com

The Library Pi project was a demonstration project for the Raspberry Pi
computer.  It is a web interface that allows you to upload a ZIP file of JPG images, which it then OCR’s using
tesseract and stores into a MySQL database. Once processing is done, you can then read and perform text-searches
against the uploaded book
